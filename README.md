# local-visual-plan

A **fully-local, no-SaaS presentation engine** for turning any topic — a
codebase, a plan, a diff, a concept, a pile of notes — into a single
**self-contained, interactive HTML file**. One base skill, **present**,
carries the general authoring and rendering craft; two thin workflow
adapters, **present-plan** and **present-recap**, sit on top of it for the two
disciplines that need more than that — getting sign-off on an implementation
plan, and recapping a git diff. All three share one renderer: scannable
steps, annotated diffs and code, file trees, data-model and API-contract
blocks, Mermaid diagrams, UI wireframes, callouts, chapters with a side nav,
before/after tabs, collapsible sections, an open-questions list you can answer
inline, and a click-to-annotate review layer that exports straight back into
the agent.

(These skills were named `visual-plan` / `visual-recap` through 2026-06, then
`presentation-plan` / `presentation-recap` through early 2026-07 — same
engine, renamed twice as the shape of the work clarified: first out from
under BuilderIO's naming, then split so the general capability wasn't trapped
under "plan". `install.sh` retires both prior generations' names on install so
no generation ever double-triggers.)

## Why

BuilderIO's `visual-plan` / `visual-recap` skills nail the *presentation* of an
agent's plan, but they're a thin client for a hosted service: the default mode
ships your plan and diff content to their servers, "local-files" mode still
renders by loading their hosted web app (needs internet + their domain), and
"self-hosted" means standing up a full Nitro + Drizzle + Cloudflare + Expo stack
with a database.

This project keeps the genuinely-good part — the high-fidelity *viewing*
experience and the planning discipline (research-first, lead-with-reuse, decide
hard-to-reverse bets first, a single open-questions block) — and drops the
hosted dependency entirely.

## What's new since v1

- **Interactive questions + a verdict.** Each open question in a `questions`
  block renders as a form — *Accept default* / *Answer differently* — and the
  review panel collects one overall verdict (approve / request-changes).
- **Click-to-annotate review.** Note mode lets you pin a note on any anchored
  element (a step, a diff hunk, a paragraph, a whole block), marked *for the
  agent* or *note to self*; **Export** copies a structured blob you paste back
  into the agent, which resolves it to exact `plan.md` lines and acts on it.
- **Chapters + side nav.** `<!-- chapter: Title -->` directives split one file
  into sections with a scrollspy sidebar and deep links — still one HTML file.
- **`callout` block** — `tone=info|decision|warning|risk` — for a decision or
  warning that shouldn't get lost in prose.
- **`data-model` block** — schema entities/fields with `filetree`-style change
  flags (`+ ~ - .`), `was:` old-value annotations, PK/FK badges, and
  Mermaid-ER-style relation lines rendered as a list — for showing *what
  changed* about a schema, which a Mermaid `erDiagram` can't express.
- **`api-endpoint` block** — a method + path badge, flagged param lines
  (`path|query|header|body|auth`), and `request:` / `response <code>:` JSON
  rendered as zero-JS collapsible trees. Both new blocks get field-level
  anchors, so a review note can pin to a single column or query param.
- **Stable anchors + a baked-in source map.** Every heading, paragraph, step,
  diff hunk, and block gets a content-derived id; the page embeds an
  anchor → `plan.md` line-range map plus the `plan.md` source itself, so an
  exported note resolves back to exact lines even without the original file at hand.
- **`check.mjs`** — a best-effort diagram validator: loads the rendered page in
  whatever local headless Chromium it can find and fails, listing captions,
  for any Mermaid diagram that didn't render to SVG; skips cleanly with no
  browser available.
- **Secret redaction (recap).** `recap.mjs` masks token-shaped strings (API
  keys, AWS-style keys, PEM headers, `Authorization:` values) before diff
  content enters a block.
- **Viewed checkboxes (recap).** One per diff tab, persisted, so a large
  multi-file review survives across sittings.

All of the above persists to `localStorage` keyed `pf:<docId>` — see Offline
guarantee below: none of it leaves the machine either.

## Offline / self-contained guarantee

The renderer emits **one `.html` file** with everything inlined: the stylesheet,
the interactivity JS, and (unless `--lean`) the Mermaid bundle. **No external
URLs, no CDN, no web fonts, no network at view time, no server, no account.** It
renders fully offline from `file://` — disconnect your network and it still
works. Dependencies (`marked`, `mermaid`) are **vendored** in
`renderer/vendor/`, so there is **zero `npm install`**. Notes, question
answers, and the verdict you pin in the annotation layer live in the browser's
`localStorage` (or, where that's blocked, in page memory) — Export is the only
way any of it leaves the page, and that's a manual copy/paste you control.

> Trust boundary: `wireframe` block bodies are intentionally passed through as
> HTML (authored by your agent, viewed locally). Do not render plan files from
> untrusted sources.

## Use it

### Via the skill (recommended)

Install (below), then ask your agent to **"present X"** / **"explain this repo
visually"** / **"make me a page about X"** / `/present` for anything you want
to see rather than read as chat text — a codebase, an architecture, an idea,
a concept, a comparison of options.

For an implementation plan you need to sign off on before code is written:
**"make me a presentation plan"** / **"plan this visually"** / `/present-plan`
(the older `/visual-plan` and `/presentation-plan` still describe the same
intent, if that's your muscle memory). The skill researches the codebase
read-only, writes a `plan.md` in the documented format, runs the renderer, and
opens the result — then, once you've pinned notes or answered the open
questions in the page and hit Export, paste the result back and the agent
ingests it (see `skills/present/references/feedback.md`).

For a diff instead of a forward plan: **"recap this PR"** / **"what changed"**
/ `/present-recap` (`/visual-recap` / `/presentation-recap`, formerly).

### Raw renderer

Run from the repo root (the paths below are repo-relative). When a skill is
**installed** (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/present`), invoke the renderer by its
path inside that install dir instead — `node <skill-dir>/renderer/render.mjs …`
— since your shell's cwd is usually the project you're presenting, not the
skill.

```sh
node skills/present/renderer/render.mjs doc.md --open
```

For a diff instead of a forward doc (shares the same engine):

```sh
node skills/present/renderer/recap.mjs [<range>] --open
```

Common flags:

- `--out <path>` — write the HTML somewhere specific.
- `--lean` — drop the inlined Mermaid bundle for a tiny file (diagrams show as
  labeled code blocks instead).
- `--open` / `--no-open` — open the result in the browser (via the opener's
  `$BROWSER` → `wslview` → `explorer.exe` → `xdg-open` fallback chain). Default
  is **not** to open unless `--open` is passed.

By default the HTML is written to `./.visual-plans/<slug>/index.html` relative to
the current directory (`<slug>` is the kebab-cased title), falling back to
`/tmp/visual-plans/<slug>/index.html` when the working directory isn't writable.
`.visual-plans/` is gitignored.

There's also a programmatic API:

```js
import { renderPlan } from './skills/present/renderer/render.mjs'
const { html, title, slug, warnings } = renderPlan(markdownSource, { lean: false })
```

## Share it

Every rendered page can get a URL. Two modes, one verb:

- `share.mjs <page>` pushes the HTML to your VM and hands back a durable,
  VPN-scoped `/p/:id` link — paste it into a PR comment.
- `share.mjs <page> --tunnel` skips the VM: serves the file locally and opens
  an ephemeral **public** tunnel (plain `ssh` to a pinggy-style endpoint, no
  account needed) for "look at this now" over Teams, before any PR exists.

### Deploy the store

Same handler core, either mount. Standalone, zero-dependency:

```sh
PRESENT_SHARE_TOKEN=your-secret node share/serve.mjs --port 8787
```

Dropped into an existing fastify server:

```js
import sharePlugin from './share/fastify-plugin.mjs'
app.register(sharePlugin, { token: process.env.PRESENT_SHARE_TOKEN, dir: './share-data' })
```

`PRESENT_SHARE_DIR` (default `./share-data`) holds `manifest.json` plus one
`<id>.html` per share; a daily sweep deletes anything past its TTL. Tokens can
also live in `<dir>/tokens.json` — a label plus a sha256 hash per secret —
instead of one shared `PRESENT_SHARE_TOKEN`. `share/` is infra you deploy
yourself; `install.sh` never touches it. Only `renderer/share.mjs` — the CLI
below — ships with the installed skills, and it's self-contained rather than
importing `share/core.mjs`, since an installed skill dir doesn't carry
`share/` alongside it.

### Use it from the CLI

```sh
node skills/present/renderer/share.mjs .visual-plans/my-plan/index.html --server https://vm.example
node skills/present/renderer/share.mjs .visual-plans/my-plan/index.html --server https://vm.example --pr 482
node skills/present/renderer/share.mjs .visual-plans/my-plan/index.html --tunnel --minutes 30
```

`POST /p` takes a Bearer upload token and the raw `text/html` body, an
optional `?ttl_days=` (default 90, `0` = forever), and caps uploads at 8 MiB
by default (`PRESENT_SHARE_MAX_BYTES`) — `docId`/`title` are lifted straight
from the page's own `pf-anchor-map`, so the store never needs telling what it
received. `GET /p/:id` serves the page back; `GET /healthz` is a liveness
check.

### Security posture

The upload token is the trust boundary — anyone holding it can publish
arbitrary HTML at your VM's origin, so it's hashed at rest, capped in size,
and meant to be rotated by editing one env var (or one `tokens.json` row).
Every served page gets a lock-down CSP — `default-src 'none'; script-src
'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'; img-src data:; font-src data:` —
enforcing the offline promise server-side: inline everything, reach nothing,
so even a hostile wireframe body can't phone home from a reviewer's browser.
Keep viewing inside your VPN, same as today. Tunnel mode trades that away on
purpose: the link is unguessable but public internet for its lifetime;
`share.mjs` prints that warning on every `--tunnel` run and refuses when the
page's title matches `PRESENT_NO_TUNNEL_PATTERN` (a regex you configure for
confidential markers).

### Inline PR fallback

`render.mjs --github` writes a `github.md` next to the output: a degraded
GitHub-flavored rendition — native `mermaid` fences, callouts as GitHub
alerts, wireframes as placeholders — good enough to preview inline in a PR
comment with zero clicks, alongside or instead of the hosted link.

## Install

```sh
./install.sh
```

Idempotent — re-run any time to update. It installs **all three** skills into
each agent skill dir, first removing installs from both prior name
generations (`visual-plan`, `visual-recap`, `presentation-plan`,
`presentation-recap`) so no generation ever double-triggers:

- `present/` — the base skill; `renderer/` and `references/` live here
  natively, so the install is fully self-sufficient.
- `present-plan/` — its own `SKILL.md`, plus a copy of `present`'s
  `renderer/` and `references/` (each adapter gets its own copy so it never
  depends on `present` also being installed).
- `present-recap/` — same treatment: its own `SKILL.md`, its own copy of the
  engine.

Targets:

- `~/.claude/skills/` — Claude Code
- `~/.agents/skills/` — shared path for Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, OpenCode,
  Copilot

The script resolves its own location, so you can run it from anywhere. If it ever
loses its executable bit: `chmod +x install.sh` (or run `sh install.sh`).

```

The renderer lives **inside** `skills/present/` on purpose: the dev layout and
the installed layout are identical, so `SKILL.md` always references the
renderer at the stable relative path `renderer/render.mjs`. `present-plan`
and `present-recap` don't keep their own copy of the engine in this repo —
`install.sh` copies `present`'s `renderer/` and `references/` into each at
install time, and their `SKILL.md` paths (`<skill-dir>/renderer/…`,
`<skill-dir>/references/…`) assume that installed layout.

## Credits & inspiration

This project was inspired by
[BuilderIO/skills](https://github.com/BuilderIO/skills) — specifically their
`visual-plan` and `visual-recap` skills, whose presentation quality and
planning discipline (research-first, lead-with-reuse, decide hard-to-reverse
bets first, a single open-questions block) set the bar. The planning discipline
here is adapted from that work; the renderer and everything it emits are an
independent, fully-local implementation.
